# Document-Health

A simple bash script that asks the user for the glasses of water drunk and
the hours of sitting on a chair for the day, and documents it in a file
called data.txt.

## For example:
ons 4 jan 2022 16:01:30 CET
Glasses of water: 5
Hours on a chair: 3

ons 5 jan 2022 22:06:40 CET
Glasses of water: 8
Hours on a chair: 5
